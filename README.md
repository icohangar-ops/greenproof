# GreenProof

**AI-native carbon credit verification — on-chain and composable.** Verification scores are minted as on-chain credentials that any marketplace, registry, or compliance tool can query.

## The Problem

The voluntary carbon market is projected to reach **$2B by 2030**, but faces three critical trust problems:

1. **Slow verification** — Third-party audits take 6–18 months and cost $15K–$50K+ per project
2. **Trust deficit** — 10–30% of registry credits may represent limited real-world emission reductions ("ghost credits")
3. **Fragmented liquidity** — Credits are siloed across dozens of registries with no unified verification standard

Existing blockchain carbon credit projects verify off-chain and store results on-chain. **GreenProof flips this**: the AI verification verdict itself is a composable on-chain credential that any protocol can query, build on, and trust.

## What GreenProof Does

```
Project Documentation → AI Verification (Qwen LLM) → On-Chain Credential (PSP34 NFT)
                                                          ↓
                                              Marketplace (escrow trading)
                                                          ↓
                                              Composable API (any protocol can query)
```

1. **AI Verification** — Qwen LLM evaluates 7 criteria (additionality, permanence, measurability, leakage, methodology, documentation, compliance) and produces a structured 0–100 score with risk classification and actionable recommendations
2. **On-Chain Credential** — Verified credits are minted as PSP34 NFTs with rich metadata: project details, verification history, vintage year, credit standard
3. **Composable API** — Any marketplace, registry, or compliance tool can query verification scores via smart contract or REST API

## Why On-Chain Verification Scores?

| Off-Chain Verification (status quo) | On-Chain Verification (GreenProof) |
|---|---|
| Score lives in a PDF on a registry website | Score is a PSP34 NFT with structured metadata |
| Can't be queried programmatically | Any contract can call `get_verification_score()` |
| Trust depends on the registry's reputation | Trust is anchored in blockchain immutability |
| No composability — each marketplace re-verifies | Composable — one verification, many consumers |

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/icohangar-ops/greenproof.git
cd greenproof

# Python backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
PYTHONPATH=py-src python -m greenverify.api.main

# Dashboard (http://localhost:3001)
cd dashboard && npm install && npm run dev

# Landing page (http://localhost:3002)
cd landing && npm install && npm run dev
```

Set `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY` to enable AI verification.

## Smart Contracts

### `carbon-credit` — PSP34 NFT

> **Build note:** `carbon-credit` implements the PSP34 NFT standard (ownership,
> approvals, total supply and the Enumerable extension) **natively** on
> `ink::storage::Mapping`, with no external framework. It builds on **stable
> Rust with ink! 5**, alongside `marketplace` and `verifier-registry`, and is a
> first-class member of the workspace. (It was previously built on OpenBrush
> 3.x, which required nightly Rust and ink! 4; that dependency has been removed.)

- **Standard**: PSP34 (ERC-721 equivalent) with a native Enumerable extension
- **Metadata**: Project name, verification date, verifier account, vintage year, credit standard (VCS/GS/CDM), country, project type
- **Operations**: `mint` (owner), `burn` (retirement), `transfer_credit`
- **Indexing**: Blake2x256 hash on project name

### `marketplace` — Escrow Trading

- Seller approves → `list(token_id, price)` → NFT into escrow
- Buyer → `buy(token_id)` with POT → NFT to buyer, POT to seller
- Events: `Listed`, `Sold`, `Delisted`

### `verifier-registry` — AI Verifier Management

- Register authorized AI verification agents
- Status management (active/suspended)
- Queries: `is_verifier()`, `get_all_verifiers()`
